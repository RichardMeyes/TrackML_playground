The submission file must associate each hit in each event to one and only one reconstructed particle track.
The reconstructed tracks must be uniquely identified only within each event.
Participants are advised to compress the submission file (with zip, bzip2, gzip) before submission to the Kaggle site.

event_id: numerical identifier of the event; corresponds to the number found in the per-event file name prefix.
hit_id: numerical identifier of the hit inside the event as defined in the per-event hits file.
track_id: user-defined numerical identifier (non-negative integer) of the track.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) associate every hit in every event with a corresponding particle
2) this way, connect hits associated with the same particle to the same track

learning objective: predict tracks for all particles.
supervised learning for time series: input is particle id, particle origin, and output are the hits in the particles track.
ToDo: revise objective as particle information is not available for the test set!
New idea: for all particles in all events: fit trajectory, than in the test data, for each hit, calculate the distance to
all trajectories so that each point has a probability of how like it belongs to a trajectory,
1) ToDo: read all particle_ids and store for each particle, the number of events, nuimber of hits per event. (done)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToDo: find out if particle_ids occur repeatedly across events (done)
within a single event's truth file, one particle may have several hits
within a single event, there are particle_ids in the particles file that were never detected
sanity check: there are no particles detected that are not found in the thruth file
[!!!] across events, a single particle_id may be detected, i.e. information about a single particle and its trajectories can be gathered across events!
e.g. 1565/1312 particles that are in the particles/truth file in event 1001 are also found in event 1000
