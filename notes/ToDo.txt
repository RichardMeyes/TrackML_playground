The submission file must associate each hit in each event to one and only one reconstructed particle track.
The reconstructed tracks must be uniquely identified only within each event.
Participants are advised to compress the submission file (with zip, bzip2, gzip) before submission to the Kaggle site.

event_id: numerical identifier of the event; corresponds to the number found in the per-event file name prefix.
hit_id: numerical identifier of the hit inside the event as defined in the per-event hits file.
track_id: user-defined numerical identifier (non-negative integer) of the track.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) associate evry hit in every event with a corresponding particle
2) this way, connect hits associated with the same particle to the same track

learning objective: predict tracks for all particles.
supervised learning for time series: input is particle id, particle origin, and output are the hits in the particles track.
